# ddns_ovh
The DDNS script for OVH automatically updates the public IP address assigned to an OVH domain every 30 minutes. It uses the ipify API to retrieve the current IP address and sends an update to the OVH DDNS system. All operational messages are logged in a log file, making it easy to monitor the process.
